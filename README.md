### üìù Project Write-up (Technical Approach Summary)

This project was developed in Python, with the core logic encapsulated in an object-oriented `ShoppingAssistant` class to ensure the code is modular and maintainable.

The heart of the application is a multi-stage NLP pipeline that processes raw user commands. Instead of relying on rigid inputs, the pipeline first identifies the user's intent (e.g., "add," "find") from natural phrases. It then isolates the item details and enriches them by correcting spelling errors with `rapidfuzz`, normalizing synonyms, and converting plurals to a singular, canonical form using the `inflect` library. This robust data handling prevents duplicates and ensures data consistency.

The backend is powered by a lightweight Flask server, which provides a simple web UI and API endpoints for handling commands. Voice recognition is implemented in the browser using the `MediaRecorder` API; the captured audio is sent to a server endpoint, converted from WebM to WAV format in-memory using `ffmpeg`, and then transcribed via the `SpeechRecognition` library. All application data, including the user's list and shopping history, is persisted to a local JSON file, demonstrating a complete, full-stack application loop.
